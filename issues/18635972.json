I also tried Cinder 0.8.4 and 0.8.3. In the end I always get a link error \"Undefined symbols for architecture armv7\" or \"Undefined symbols for architecture armv7s\". For example the Flurry lib is missing armv7s support. See screenshot attached.\r\n![link_error](https://f.cloud.github.com/assets/1117200/1038324/19858cd8-0f62-11e3-9ed4-6ba31687d1fa.png)\r\n",

I hope to find a moment soon, perhaps tonight, to get it up and running myself so I can better support curious people like you.\r\n\r\nIt was last compiled against the current master of https://github.com/bloomtime/Cinder with the XCode that was current at that time. I believe all the important settings are checked-in, but of course it's a constant battle to keep XCode projects current.\r\n\r\nIt may just be that the Flurry analytics stuff needs updating. I would also be OK with removing it from development builds with some #ifdefs.\r\n\r\nLet me know if you try anything else - and thanks for your early interest! Hope to get this smoothed out soon.",

      "body": "Firstly, a big thanks for the code release and congratulations on having your code become part of the Smithsonian. I think that's really incredible.\r\n\r\nFor the record, I am also having issues with building Planetary. This is with checking out the latest Planetary and Cinder 0.8.5, iOS 5.1 and 6.1, Xcode 4.6.2.\r\n* Home directories with a hyphen in the name do not work with the build setting you require of CINDER_PATH_(username)\r\n* Cinder requires libc++ as the C++ standard library, but the default compiler for Planetary (LLVM GCC 4.2) does not seem to allow this option to be set in Xcode. Changing the compiler and setting this to libc++ seems to work.\r\n* Other errors seem Cinder-specific, however Cinder builds successfully on its own so perhaps there is something else in the Planetary compiler settings I haven't noticed yet?\r\n  * For example, cinder's URL.h  \"UrlLoadExc\" function complains about the definition being too \"lax\" (adding a simple destructor quieted that). \r\n  * cinder's Texture.h complains about \"No matching function for call to 'make_shared' \".\r\n\r\nAs for @burkhardm, Flurry is relatively notorious for that error message. Updating the Flurry library is 99% likely necessary. I see in my Flurry dev account that their library is up to version 4.2.3 where the .h file in Planetary is at 2.8.3.",

I finally figured out what was missing for building Planetary.\r\n\r\nThe following settings were required for building Planetary with Xcode 4.6.3 and Cinder 0.8.5:\r\n1. Menu > Editor > Validate Settings > Update Settings (adds C++ Build Settings)\r\n2. Project > Targets > Planetary\r\n3. Build Settings > Architectures > Standard (armv7, armv7s)\r\n4. Build Settings > Build Active Architecture Only > No\r\n5. Build Settings > Valid Architectures > armv7\r\n6. Build Settings > iOS Deployment Target > iOS 5.0 (required for libc++)\r\n7. Build Settings > C++ Language Dialect > C++11\r\n8. Build Settings > C++ Standard Library > libc++\r\n9. Build Settings > Enable C++ Exceptions > Yes\r\n10. Build Settings > define CINDER_PATH_username\r\n11. Build Phases > Link Binary With Libraries > Add MobileCoreServices.framework\r\n12. Build Phases > Link Binary With Libraries > Add ImageIO.framework\r\n\r\n@ChristopherDrum: Surprisingly, I didn't have to update the Flurry library by setting Valid Architectures to armv7. However, I had to comment out some older touch routines in BloomScene.cpp and GestureRecognizer.h. Please note, that this will lead to updates in the submodules.",
